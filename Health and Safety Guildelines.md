HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR THE ROBOCUP RESCUE COMPETITION <br>
<br>
1. Workplace Setup <br>
  a. Ensure the workspace is well-ventilated and has adequate conditions for working <br>
  b. Keep workspace free of unnecessary objects, equipment and material to prevent obstructions and hazards that could cause injury <br>
  c. Workplace must have sufficient space to move, test and operate the robot without risk of injuring any operating persons or obstructing the robot’s path <br>
  d. Prohibit any food and drink in and around the area in which the robot is being tested <br>
  e. Ensure the testing area is sized appropriately according to the requirements of the particular task <br>
  f. Create a testing area suitable for the robot’s movement to prevent any damage to the robot’s mechanisms<br>
<br>
2. Technical Safety<br>
  a. Ensure robot is disconnected from any power sources when making any changes<br>
  b. Ensure robot is charged and maintained as per manufacturer's instruction to prevent accidental damage<br>
  c. Verify the batteries are functioning correctly and handle them according to manufacturer's guidelines<br>
  d. Avoid exposing the robot and any other technical components to moisture, water or any potential damaging elements<br>
  e. Be cautious of any moving parts of the robot such as the arms<br>
  f. Ensure the robot is turned off when making any adjustments to the physical robot to prevent injuring from accidental movement<br>
  g. Wear appropriate protective wear when required ie. when assembling or modifying parts<br>
  h. Ensure the robot is tested on a stable surface within a reasonable testing space. The space to run the robot must be well thought-out prior to testing<br>
  i. Test sensors and cameras in safe, obstacle-free spaces to avoid collisions.<br>
  j. Monitor power usage and robot temperature during long periods of testing to prevent overheating of components.<br>
<br>
3. Robot Handling<br>
  a. Avoid lifting the robot by delicate components such as sensors or cameras to prevent damage<br>
  b. When transporting the robot, ensure to secure it properly within its casing to prevent any damage to the robot<br>
  c. When running tests, particularly for autonomous or terrain navigation, always have an emergency stop or manual override readily accessible<br>
<br>
4. Emergency Procedures<br>
  a. Have a first-aid kit available and be aware of procedures in the unlikely event of a medical injury<br>
  b. Establish an emergency shutdown procedure for the robot in case of malfunction or safety hazards<br>
  c. Follow all RoboCup Rescue guidelines and rules generally to ensure your robot complies with competition requirements<br>
