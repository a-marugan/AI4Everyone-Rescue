HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR THE ROBOCUP RESCUE COMPETITION

Workplace Setup
Ensure the workspace is well-ventilated and has adequate conditions for working
Keep workspace free of unnecessary objects, equipment and material to prevent obstructions and hazards that could cause injury
Workplace must have sufficient space to move, test and operate the robot without risk of injuring any operating persons or obstructing the robot’s path
Prohibit any food and drink in and around the area in which the robot is being tested
Ensure the testing area is sized appropriately according to the requirements of the particular task
Create a testing area suitable for the robot’s movement to prevent any damage to the robot’s mechanisms

Technical Safety
Ensure robot is disconnected from any power sources when making any changes
Ensure robot is charged and maintained as per manufacturer's instruction to prevent accidental damage
Verify the batteries are functioning correctly and handle them according to manufacturer's guidelines
Avoid exposing the robot and any other technical components to moisture, water or any potential damaging elements
Be cautious of any moving parts of the robot such as the arms
Ensure the robot is turned off when making any adjustments to the physical robot to prevent injuring from accidental movement
Wear appropriate protective wear when required ie. when assembling or modifying parts
Ensure the robot is tested on a stable surface within a reasonable testing space. The space to run the robot must be well thought-out prior to testing
Test sensors and cameras in safe, obstacle-free spaces to avoid collisions.
Monitor power usage and robot temperature during long periods of testing to prevent overheating of components.

Robot Handling
Avoid lifting the robot by delicate components such as sensors or cameras to prevent damage
When transporting the robot, ensure to secure it properly within its casing to prevent any damage to the robot
When running tests, particularly for autonomous or terrain navigation, always have an emergency stop or manual override readily accessible

Emergency Procedures
Have a first-aid kit available and be aware of procedures in the unlikely event of a medical injury
Establish an emergency shutdown procedure for the robot in case of malfunction or safety hazards
Follow all RoboCup Rescue guidelines and rules generally to ensure your robot complies with competition requirements
