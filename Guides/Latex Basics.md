## What is LaTeX
LaTeX is a software-based tool that creates professional documents. It allows the writer to focus purely on the contents, while LaTeX automaticlaly controls the formatting. By separating contents from style, LaTeX is similar to a highly customisable and specialised markdown software. 

## Platforms
One of the most popular LaTeX platforms is the online site [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/login). It supports multiple contributers collaborating on the same document, in a similar manner to Google Documents. Log in with your UNSW account to access some of the premium features.

## Resources
LaTeX has been covered extensively online. In most cases, you'll use a provided template document and simply fill in the contents with plain text. However, here are a few tutorials to get started with:
