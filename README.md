# Project Description

The AI-4-Everyone project involves the development of a **virtual** Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) robot to navigate through urban environments and conduct operations that would otherwise be dangerous for humans.​ The robot will employ exploration, mapping, and computer vision techniques to map the environment and locate potential survivors and victims.​ The main objective of the project will be to develop this robot for the RoboCup league 2025.
